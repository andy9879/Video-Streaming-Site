As the war rages on and the innocent get caught in its destruction, Maria becomes fed up with the situation and begins using her magic to try and prevent further conflict in hopes of maintaining peace. However, her constant intervention soon attracts the attention of the heavens, and the archangel Michael is sent to keep her from meddling in human affairs. The divine being confronts Maria, and he forbids her from using her powers, issuing a decree that her magic will be taken if she loses her virginity. Though she is now labeled a heretic, Maria adamantly refuses to heed Michael's warning and continues to disrupt the war between the two nations. But as the Church begins plotting to take away the witch's power and put a stop to Maria's interference once and for all, her peacemaking may soon come to an end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574476566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457447656673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457447656733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574476566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574174464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574174466b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446673d"],"genres":["Comedy","Historical","Magic","Romance","Fantasy","Seinen"],"score":"7.15","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 11, 2015 to Mar 29, 2015","synonyms":["Junketsu no Maria: Sorcière de gré","pucelle de force"],"englishTitle":"Maria the Virgin Witch","japaneseTitle":"純潔のマリア","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26441/Junketsu_no_Maria","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z29gaSlNJB8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Maria-the-Virgin-Witch-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/darling-in-the-franxx-dub.b321/5d569c5","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1614/90408.jpg","name":"Darling in the FranXX (Dub)","plot":"In the distant future, humanity has been driven to near-extinction by giant beasts known as Klaxosaurs, forcing the surviving humans to take refuge in massive fortress cities called Plantations. Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  \n\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the \"Partner Killer.\" Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534674566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534674566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c4d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c6b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c6f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534675314d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534675316b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531673d"],"genres":["Action","Drama","Mecha","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"score":"7.33","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 13, 2018 to Jul 7, 2018","synonyms":[""],"englishTitle":"DARLING in the FRANXX","japaneseTitle":"ダーリン・イン・ザ・フランキス","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35849/Darling_in_the_FranXX","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giD4G9qlzDs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Darling-in-the-FranXX-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/gangsta-dub.71be/474db63","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/74415.jpg","name":"Gangsta.

Though long thought to be extinct, wolves still exist and live amongst humans, disguising themselves through elaborate illusions. \n\nA lone wolf named Kiba finds himself drawn by an intoxicating scent to Freeze City, an impoverished town under the rule of the callous Lord Orkham. Here, Kiba discovers that wolves Hige, Tsume, and Toboe have been drawn in by the same aroma. By following the fragrance of \"Lunar Flowers,\" said to be the key to opening the door to their ideal world, the wolves set off on a journey across desolate landscapes and crumbling cities to find their legendary promised land. However, they are not the only ones seeking paradise, and those with more sinister intentions will do anything in their power to reach it first.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427556773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427556383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427556343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4275566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427556673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427556733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4275566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c4d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c6b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f42766c6f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4276314d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4276316b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427631733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4276316f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f4276464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427646493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=556f4f427646303d"],"genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"score":"7.82","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 7, 2003 to Jul 29, 2003","synonyms":["Wolf Rain"],"englishTitle":"Wolf's Rain","japaneseTitle":"ウルフズレイン","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ydbrdQXMeM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Wolf's-Rain-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/baccano.f0c5/e4c05a2","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547.jpg","name":"Baccano!","plot":"During the early 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country.

Soon, they join the fight against the \"Beastmen,\" humanoid creatures that terrorize the remnants of humanity in powerful robots called \"Gunmen.\" Although they face some challenges and setbacks, the trio bravely fights these new enemies alongside other survivors to reclaim the surface, while slowly unraveling a galaxy-sized mystery.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943447656673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943447656733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434476566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174466b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417446733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174466f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174564d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943417456733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434174566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594341756c4d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594341756c493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594341756c303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594341756c773d"],"genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Mecha","Sci-Fi"],"score":"8.66","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Apr 1, 2007 to Sep 30, 2007","synonyms":["Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann","Making Break-Through Gurren Lagann","Heavenly Breakthrough Gurren Lagann","TTGL","Gurren Laggan"],"englishTitle":"Gurren Lagann","japaneseTitle":"天元突破グレンラガン","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAQylCHv8Cw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Gurren-Lagann-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]}],"sponsor":"admin","keys":[{"key":"99c08faf1b26eb0507772411be1a503e8ebc775d00b9e85745d870ed5bae79dcb40c708b811deca1fb4a38bcb58b688966272f848b8b6be5fe04b34ec7f06a9ccd3d6ad2e5738683c6edec8cadeb701f8156b6c3e42fcf2c232779f60e46bd5b352c64c5a7ecaf4ef3a0a897c0ceb8cc51a89e5700459fe4614a9ea226700358","keyExpo":1654339696207,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"9cc2ae0ab696bbabc2b6663b2808b2c4ceef1c83b5a59e1f9b0ef36e8094d39cbbb28ab1b6be364a986c02b9aad287b7706ce66afdf0ae8c3107e4dea285766d4a13d39f587fce37adb3599e58fd008f119a759fb67244204d1e3812b511448a8f8dea66e51eb6e54915e0672697e706bab2045d12a6cd7f196da7501282f0a3","keyExpo":1655026056571,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"a84054b7be03205dcb7c3c89d749d14de7cd3eb55ae7a7b479313f9b12f77b334563edafd8a2a5168576ac26746fa8d0337952b4e5bdf09aa761a93bf8908946529f017f79583c843285487dc2c23ba4d0e57e3eb3a141a9fa5400dc816417ac4d364e2e6b12a7d7f81740108eac6816054f919c73556baec7df9da9f0016dfe","keyExpo":1663742745350,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"7843c61879bcf92a5bb7f821110ed5a5d583f37dd3f79ff22c5d382d20eefd7bec9ae83aa91ae8216c7b888a0439062adfbb790d846edc3f34ebb4a1a6807e311987802f51344ddd4a64b4d224c855c9678d3bbb3d3a623b480f406b3160141acd3a73f33226bbba639903f898aff759fe7c9bdf7393afa5d5b6debc7c3235e5","keyExpo":1661653652682,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"5b2f77f010923a8cf94f674ba9ee3e82375f8a3e37875e78bd1da2acae0859c754e2026175b97ecee1ba4662391aec21979aa1fcfea425d6d419639119ffafde288fa8c0f49b7be3d9674b20af97f34e091557c696525ffea16023d78c2060dc74ee895c908e30af805894287f4fd070fd43e7730f869a7a4300b5afd86b73cd","keyExpo":1707938886870,"rememberMe":false}],"password":"10388a133dada0caa5af6045d888c0ce3289a1fd851a3c89298cb2211a8a4f22"},{"username":"kbaum286","passwd":"ed2ef89721f420ce056544f2cdcfc8d0109345ecff7c253752c77dffdbdbe185","bookmarked":[],"watched":{"Black-Lagoon":[0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],"Beastars-(Dub)":[0],"Spirited-Away-(Dub)":[0]},"sponsor":"admin","keys":[]},{"username":"Ethelow","passwd":"c421cc1b66727dc16b8124aa889446fcfb02c536ed291a740d3371005e2c66a2","bookmarked":[],"watched":{"No-Guns-Life":[0],"No-Guns-Life-2nd-Season":[0],"Groove-Adventure-Rave-(Dub)":[0,1],"Radiant-(Dub)":[0,1],"Radiant-2nd-Season":[0]},"sponsor":"admin","keys":[]}]
