As the war rages on and the innocent get caught in its destruction, Maria becomes fed up with the situation and begins using her magic to try and prevent further conflict in hopes of maintaining peace. However, her constant intervention soon attracts the attention of the heavens, and the archangel Michael is sent to keep her from meddling in human affairs. The divine being confronts Maria, and he forbids her from using her powers, issuing a decree that her magic will be taken if she loses her virginity. Though she is now labeled a heretic, Maria adamantly refuses to heed Michael's warning and continues to disrupt the war between the two nations. But as the Church begins plotting to take away the witch's power and put a stop to Maria's interference once and for all, her peacemaking may soon come to an end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574476566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457447656673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457447656733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574476566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574174464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534574174466b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553457417446673d"],"genres":["Comedy","Historical","Magic","Romance","Fantasy","Seinen"],"score":"7.15","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 11, 2015 to Mar 29, 2015","synonyms":["Junketsu no Maria: Sorcière de gré","pucelle de force"],"englishTitle":"Maria the Virgin Witch","japaneseTitle":"純潔のマリア","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/26441/Junketsu_no_Maria","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z29gaSlNJB8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Maria-the-Virgin-Witch-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/darling-in-the-franxx-dub.b321/5d569c5","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1614/90408.jpg","name":"Darling in the FranXX (Dub)","plot":"In the distant future, humanity has been driven to near-extinction by giant beasts known as Klaxosaurs, forcing the surviving humans to take refuge in massive fortress cities called Plantations. Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race.  \n\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the \"Partner Killer.\" Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534674566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467456733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534674566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c4d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c6b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=55345346756c6f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534675314d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5534534675316b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=553453467531673d"],"genres":["Action","Drama","Mecha","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"score":"7.33","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 13, 2018 to Jul 7, 2018","synonyms":[""],"englishTitle":"DARLING in the FRANXX","japaneseTitle":"ダーリン・イン・ザ・フランキス","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35849/Darling_in_the_FranXX","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giD4G9qlzDs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Darling-in-the-FranXX-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/gangsta-dub.71be/474db63","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/74415.jpg","name":"Gangsta.

Eventually, seven powerful states emerged from the endless cycle of warfare.\n\nIn the kingdom of Qin, Li Xin, a war-orphaned slave, trains vigorously with fellow slave and best friend, Piao, who shares his proud dream of one day becoming a Great General of the Heavens. However, the two are suddenly forced to part ways when Piao is recruited to work in the royal palace by a retainer of the King.\n\nAfter a fierce coup d'état unfolds, Piao returns to Xin, half dead, with a mission that will lead him to a meeting with China's young King, Ying Zheng, who bears a striking resemblance to Piao. Kingdom follows Xin as he takes his first steps into the great blood-soaked pages of China's history. He must carve his own path to glory on his long quest to become a Great General of the historic Seven Warring States.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477531673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477531733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775316f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775466b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477546733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775466f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775564d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775566b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477556733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434775566f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c4d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c6b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594347766c6f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=5859434776314d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477631493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477631303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477631773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=585943477631383d"],"genres":["Action","Historical","Military","Seinen"],"score":"8.03","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jun 4, 2012 to Feb 25, 2013","synonyms":[""],"englishTitle":"Kingdom","japaneseTitle":"キングダム","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12031/Kingdom","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmDorgdAG4g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Kingdom-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]},{"anime":{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/akatsuki-no-yona-dub.b47d/49c4bd1","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/64225.jpg","name":"Akatsuki no Yona (Dub)","plot":"Princess Yona lives a life of luxury and ease, completely sheltered from the problems of the seemingly peaceful Kingdom of Kouka; however, the sudden murder of the king and betrayal of her beloved cousin Su-won places Yona's life in mortal peril. Forced to escape only with Son Hak, who is both her childhood friend and bodyguard, the naïve princess soon discovers that Kouka is not the idyllic place she envisioned it to be. Poverty, strife, and corruption run rampant, making reclaiming the throne nothing more than a wishful fantasy given the kingdom's current state.\n\nBased on the popular manga of the same name by Mizuho Kusanagi, Akatsuki no Yona follows Princess Yona on a coming-of-age adventure as she faces the harsh realities of her kingdom. With only a mysterious legend to guide her, Yona must discover a way to restore Kouka to its former glory while being pursued relentlessly by the forces of the new King of Kouka.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","ep":["https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875314d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875316b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487531733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875316f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875464d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546773d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546383d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546343d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875466b3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546673d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487546733d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875466f3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f4875564d3d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487556493d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487556303d","https://media.opencdn.co/?id=58594f487556773d"],"genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Romance","Shoujo"],"score":"8.05","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Oct 7, 2014 to Mar 24, 2015","synonyms":["Yona: The girl standing in the blush of dawn"],"englishTitle":"Yona of the Dawn","japaneseTitle":"暁のヨナ","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbXTfrDueNw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Akatsuki-no-Yona-(Dub)"},"watched":false,"episodes":[]}],"sponsor":"admin","keys":[{"key":"30e4c88d8260cd934080537608bc27d267966e457c3b9b31f283ec32ef00ed8e04ec6bec6388946163e147d61be171aa92fb1701d11c29c61c2c3156da674528fe0d9b3cbad5e45f58316ddcbe992e8178f1a3eae6969f99a1fe720466b9ce33410252a643d28826e6741f169eb24794d969ce1b0271ea437c8a061b56cffd6a","keyExpo":1645999818781,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"742295ace67be45b31db9bb9448d64605ea6ca7366e0980db379f057b8bb0f5898d20abf5f23277c35eee35c9b6297884a90e78ef47c2c9ff7f635f6ebd8376f8fb32050b91c24f04dfe7b7622e697ba261fb0b14fb9f227c213d7879b4a8fd83d8f2285404f58d8a2636dbedf58dfa4cd0bde921bbfa1bbf48a7831fa67a8ea","keyExpo":1645835216845,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"9fde295c2d95f0d27366df52784e3f0e190aa268c69eb56716c85b122386f86980a6361d27a081f8590a0ac48e23c807e1820afc18a6cbdc3a27b6e4a7791a7261786c934105c50a3a516370f6d78b91f966903a32c8bd49614eda961365aaa003de104c91c9328bc99a42cd9148686b02c7476b30a6c2bf978ee8db92eda244","keyExpo":1651037235183,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"67edcedd93b30c9fa6d0a9bfa57111ee8e03116cab9db6de0dfdc4fa2728bf8192721f6e876294c284058fa302bd18644d2a729cd7ce84ec6a623d2f3c0cf1f2d70c40a7a23e190d5310a3104c65cb95d5b1d4b1c0136d9088c484780fbda405f4b276246f8ad52f3c73b47017941625f55e7de4eabd9dcc6dc1ecde3b1f634b","keyExpo":1650878892066,"rememberMe":true},{"key":"432818422b1e743bcff00abd5e6acdf0f66be8f8c6025346816efc37a093f6a3cb3ce73b1b3188996bebae3b62b734048d95cc5355cafcf21698385451ade4bac43642c719b1f4fa30c3dd571ab7349ffe500771fe0412e3dabc4ea9d556f54dcf946403f21d3d11cf8f3bc4c038123514f5f03c62b5b0c260ba4b2913c78c78","keyExpo":1652574876550,"rememberMe":true}],"password":"10388a133dada0caa5af6045d888c0ce3289a1fd851a3c89298cb2211a8a4f22"},{"username":"kbaum286","passwd":"ed2ef89721f420ce056544f2cdcfc8d0109345ecff7c253752c77dffdbdbe185","bookmarked":[],"watched":{"Black-Lagoon":[0,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],"Beastars-(Dub)":[0],"Spirited-Away-(Dub)":[0]},"sponsor":"admin","keys":[]}]
