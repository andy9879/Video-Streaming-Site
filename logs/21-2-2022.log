One day, while swimming at Mio Sun Beach, his leg suddenly cramps. No one is close enough to notice his desperate screams for help, and so he sinks into the ocean, where he is left to drown alone. Just as he loses consciousness, however, a mermaid appears and saves his life.\n\nThat night, Nagasumi is visited by his savior, a girl who introduces herself as Sun Seto—a mermaid from a yakuza family. As it turns out, under mermaid law, a mermaid whose identity is revealed to a human must be punished by execution. To avoid this harrowing outcome, the Seto family propose a solution: Nagasumi must marry Sun or die at the hands of Gouzaburou, Sun's father and boss of the Seto clan. Faced with no other option, Nagasumi takes her hand in marriage.\n\nNow, the newlyweds face the difficult task of keeping their relationship secret. Between Gouzaburou's unending attempts on Nagasumi's life and the eccentric antics of a slew of antagonists, a genuine and innocent love blossoms between the pair as they adapt to their new life. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["Comedy","Parody","Romance","School","Shounen"],"score":"7.74","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Apr 2, 2007 to Oct 1, 2007","synonyms":["The Inland Sea Bride"],"englishTitle":"My Bride is a Mermaid","japaneseTitle":"瀬戸の花嫁","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2104/Seto_no_Hanayome","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqgk9frneoA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Seto-No-Hanayome"},{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/sakura-wars-the-movie-2001.253e/a0ce1d9","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1652/90326.jpg","name":"Sakura Wars : The Movie (2001)","plot":"For this year's Nadeshiko Festival, Sakura Kinomoto's elementary school class is presenting a play.

A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["Action","Comedy","Horror","Magic","Fantasy","Seinen"],"score":"8.10","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 13, 2020 to Mar 30, 2020","synonyms":[""],"englishTitle":"","japaneseTitle":"ドロヘドロ","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38668/Dorohedoro","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IS6l1K19N1U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Dorohedoro"},{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/silver-spoon.cd90/db46813","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/49237.jpg","name":"Silver Spoon","plot":"Yuugo Hachiken is studious, hard-working, and tired of trying to live up to expectations he just cannot meet.

Force her excess blood onto random strangers, which surprisingly causes these \"victims\" to become livelier and happier than before. With her siblings—Anju, her reserved yet affectionate younger sister, and Ren, her womanizing elder brother—helping her abilities remain a secret by altering the affected humans' memories, no one is the wiser. That is, until Karin's newly transferred classmate, Kenta Usui, finds her behavior suspicious.

By monitoring citizens using special devices worn around their necks, authorities have taken extreme measures to ensure that society remains chaste. \n\nIn this world of sexual suppression, Tanukichi Okuma—son of an infamous terrorist who opposed the chastity laws—has just entered high school, offering his help to the student council in order to get close to president Anna Nishikinomiya, his childhood friend and crush. Little does he know that the vice president Ayame Kajou has a secret identity: Blue Snow, a masked criminal dedicated to spreading lewd material amongst the sheltered public—and Tanukichi has caught the girl's interest due to his father's notoriety.\n\nSoon, Tanukichi is dragged into joining her organization called SOX, where he is forced to spread obscene propaganda, helping to launch an assault against the government's oppressive rule. With their school set as the first point of attack, Tanukichi will have to do the unthinkable when he realizes that their primary target is the person he admires most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["Comedy","Ecchi","School"],"score":"7.32","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jul 4, 2015 to Sep 19, 2015","synonyms":["Shimoseka"],"englishTitle":"SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist","japaneseTitle":"下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/29786/Shimoneta_to_Iu_Gainen_ga_Sonzai_Shinai_Taikutsu_na_Sekai","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4sLMxdbnSo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Shimoneta-to-Iu-Gainen-ga-Sonzai-Shinai-Taikutsu-na-Sekai-(Dub)"},{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/boku-wa-tomodachi-ga-sukunai.9280/f6a2a3b","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/32873.jpg","name":"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai","plot":"When Kodaka Hasegawa finds out that he will be transferring to a new school, he is determined to make a positive impression, and maybe even some friends.

That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier! \n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to get back on Itsuki's good side, Uesugi finds out that his problems don't end there: Itsuki is actually a quintuplet, so in addition to her, he must also tutor her sisters—Miku, Yotsuba, Nino, and Ichika—who, despite the very real threat of flunking, want nothing to do with a tutor. However, his family's livelihood is on the line so Uesugi pushes on, adamant in his resolve to rid the sisters of their detest for studying and successfully lead them to graduation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["Harem","Comedy","Romance","School","Shounen"],"score":"7.61","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jan 11, 2019 to Mar 29, 2019","synonyms":["Gotoubun no Hanayome","The Five Wedded Brides"],"englishTitle":"The Quintessential Quintuplets","japaneseTitle":"五等分の花嫁","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38101/5-toubun_no_Hanayome","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCwfEB6PbFk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Gotoubun-no-Hanayome"},{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/kyoukai-no-rinne-tv-2nd-season.74f2/ee3cae9","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/79665.jpg","name":"Kyoukai no Rinne (TV) 2nd Season","plot":"High school student Sakura Mamiya and impoverished death god Rinne Rokudou continue to confront the supernatural.

With their school set as the first point of attack, Tanukichi will have to do the unthinkable when he realizes that their primary target is the person he admires most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["Comedy","Ecchi","School"],"score":"7.32","status":"Finished Airing","aired":"Jul 4, 2015 to Sep 19, 2015","synonyms":["Shimoseka"],"englishTitle":"SHIMONETA: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist","japaneseTitle":"下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界","mal":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/29786/Shimoneta_to_Iu_Gainen_ga_Sonzai_Shinai_Taikutsu_na_Sekai","trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4sLMxdbnSo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","nameNoSpace":"Shimoneta-to-Iu-Gainen-ga-Sonzai-Shinai-Taikutsu-na-Sekai"},{"url":"https://9anime.city/watch/shuffle.644c/da75132","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/19622.jpg","name":"Shuffle!","plot":"In present times, Gods and Demons coexist together with Humans after the door between each of these worlds had opened.
